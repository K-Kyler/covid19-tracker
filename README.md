# Covid-19 Tracker

A tracker web application that simply tracking the information about the Covid-19 victims of worldwide and countries. All information about infected, recovers and deaths are described through report cards and charts. In this project, I have been using [Coronavirus Map API](https://rapidapi.com/Yatko/api/coronavirus-map) for building features.

> The Coronavirus Map API is no longer supported.
